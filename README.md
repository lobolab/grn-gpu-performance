## Building
Two different solutions are included:
* Evolution: evolutionary algorithm for the inference of GRNs
* Viewer: user interface for visualizing the evolutionary algorithm results

Open each solution and compile them with Microsoft Visual Studio. Make sure the required dependencies are installed in your computer.

## Dependencies
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* Qt
* Qwt
* Eigen
* NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
